The master of the DA reported that the crew had spotted an individual armed with what appeared to be a gun on deck. The master indicated that the crew had locked themselves in their cabins and requested immediate assistance. Given that the vessel was in transit and its current position, the POCC advised the master to contact Batam Authority on VHF Channel 16 for help.\n\nAt around 0458 hours, VTIS Central followed up with DA to check if they had sought assistance from Batam Authority. The master confirmed that they did not require any assistance and planned to conduct a search in daylight, thus were unable to confirm if any assets were stolen. The master also stated that all crew members were accounted for, there were no injuries, and no further assistance was needed.\n\nDA is a transit vessel to Caofeidian, China.",

The ship altered its course to starboard to keep a safe distance from the boat. However, at a distance of about 1.5 miles, the boat suddenly started flashing lights and accelerated, making a desperate attempt to board the ship. The ship performed evasive manoeuvres to deter the boarding attempt, and immediately notified Singapore VTIS East. Upon sighting a RSN ship in the vicinity, the small boat aborted its attempt and moved away from the ship. The ship had implemented additional lookout measures to monitor for suspicious boats as part of its security measures, in accordance with BMP5 best practices."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While at berth, the OOW (2nd Officer) was on roving when he sighted two unidentified persons, wearing black suits with their faces painted black, hanging on the port side below the gangway ladder and attempted to board the ship. Upon realizing the OOW had spotted them, the perpetrators immediately jumped into the water. Thereafter, the 2nd Officer informed the master and called for extra hand to increase security measures. During inspection, all stores? padlocks were intact and no item was stolen. The master also informed Philippine General Santos (PHGES) agent to support the security perimeter. The guards kept watch within the wharf but were not allowed onboard the ship.\n\nOn the same day at about 0305 hrs, one unidentified person was sighted by the duty AB at the gangway area (port side) of the ship. The duty AB immediately informed the OOW and proceeded to the area. Upon seeing the duty AB, the perpetrator immediately jumped into the water. Thereafter, the master and crew carried out a search in the engine room, accommodation and main deck. They found that padlocks of the fire station locker and chemical locker were broken. However, no item was missing or stolen. Furthermore, the hospital watertight door was opened but locked from the inside door. The crew was not injured during the two occurrences.\n\nOn the same day at about 1330 hrs, the Philippine Coast Guard-Port State Control (PCG-PSC) boarded the ship and conducted verification of the incident. The master and crew were advised to be vigilant and strengthen their security measures while at Port of General Santos City.

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While at anchor, the duty watcher was proceeding to the forecastle deck (starboard side) to check the accommodation doors of the ship, a perpetrator appeared and aimed a gun at him. The perpetrator, along with four other perpetrators who served as look-outs, asked the duty watcher about the location of the storage room. The perpetrators took the duty watcher to the storage room and ordered him to open it.   \n\nThe perpetrators, then, tied the hands of the duty watcher with a rope at the forward centre bollard and stole 20 buckets of paint from the storage room. As the master and second officer of the ship could not contact the duty watcher, the deck cadet went to check.  While checking, the deck cadet noticed a perpetrator with a knife who shouted at him not to move.

Master further intimated that he had instituted regular rounds at interval of 30 min by ships deck crew while adhering to norms of social distancing. During rounds, the Chief Officer observed 02 stevedores and one supervisor, who were working on board to be sleeping and alerted him. However, the supervisor turned hostile and threatened to patrolling team. This resulted in inconsistency of rounds duration on board and master suspect that while taking advantage of this breach, probably ropes were stolen by stevedores. The ISM manger intimated that master had done due diligence of reporting to the local authorities and PFSO through agents.

The fishing boats were in the vicinity waters of Lahad Datu, Sabah, Malaysia when the perpetrators boarded the fishing boats from one jungkong-type watercraft and one speed boat painted orange and white. The ASG members abducted four crew from the first fishing boat and six crew from the second fishing boat; and were sighted in the area of Pondohan, Tabawan, Sitangkai, Tawi-tawi, Philippines at about 0330 hrs on 18 Jun 19.\n\nOn 21 Jun 19 at about 2200 hrs, elements of the maritime police station were on mobile patrol at Bgy Kahawa, Talipao, Sulu and they sighted a group of nine men walking along the road. After interviewing the men, they were confirmed to be the abducted crew who were released by their abductors who could have realised that the abducted crew had no money nor anything to give as ransom. The nine men were brought to Talipao for custody and debrief. One of the abducted crew is still missing."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While tug boat towing barge, Maritime Hawk, was underway, the Master sighted two boats at port side of barge and some unknown persons, believed to be perpetrators, attempting to climb onto the barge port quarter using a ladder. Master manuevered his vessel to warn the robber boats to move away. He also flashed the search light to one of the perpetrators who managed to climb onto the barge. The perpetrator escaped when his presence was discovered. \n\nThe tug boat came alongside the barge when it was cleared of perpetrators. The crew went on board the barge and found weapons like knife and metal hacksaw. While the crew were checking the barge, they saw the perpetrators' boats still at the vicinity, about 200 metres away from their barge.\n\nAbout an hour later, due to bad weather, Master had to cast off his vessel from the barge so that he could bring his vessel closer to port limit, as per the instruction he received from the Control Centre. Noting that the tug boat was moving closer to port limit, the perpetrator boats appeared again and was fast approaching the barge. The Master immediately manuevered his vessel and flashed the search light to warn the perpetrators' boats to move away. At one point, there were more than 2 perpetrators' boats sighted. The pair was cleared from robber boats after officers from Chittagong Coast Guard arrived at the location incident.\n\nFollowing the incident, it was reported that a locked pallet was found broken and the items stored in the pallet was found missing. Towing rope with Norwegian buoy was also found missing."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, a fast boat approached and ordered the ship to stop while firing several warning shots. The ship manoeuvred to evade possible attack but this prompted the armed men to continuously fire several shots to the ship until three armed men successfully boarded the ship. Upon boarding, they pointed guns to the crew and directed to gather at the crew deck. One of the crew members was shot when he tried to block the armed men to enter the bridge. The armed men entered the bridge and fired at the ship's navigational equipment, damaging them in the process. They then abducted six Vietnamese crew and escaped in their fast boat.\n\nPCG conducted maritime patrol together with Philippine Marine and spotted the ship drifting near Baguan Island, Turtle Island, Tawi-Tawi with 10 survivors and one casualty. The ship was towed to Taganak area, Tawi-Tawi and Philippine National Police conducted procedural crime scene investigation.\n\nThe Focal Point (Vietnam) reported to the ReCAAP ISC that while perpetrators were underway in their boat, they killed one of the abducted crew and discharged his corpse at about 06 degree 09'26'' N, 119 degree 39'18'' E.\n\nThe Focal Point (Philippines) reported to the ReCAAP ISC that on 7 July 2017, while the government troops were conducting military operations in Patikul Sulu, they recovered a cadaver. The forensic examination resulted in the identification of the body as Tran Viet Van, one of the abducted crew of Giang Hai. Several gunshot wounds were also found on the body of the victim.\n\nOn 10 Nov 17 at 0745 hrs, the following Vietnamese nationals were rescued by the government forces in the vicinity of 2 nm east of Kang Tipayan Island, Languyan, Tawi-tawi:\n\n1. Bui Xuan Vien\n2. Bui Trung Duc\n3. Nguten Quang Huy; and \n4. one lifeless body identified as Nguyen Huu Trong \n\nThe Vietnamese nationals were then transported to Zamboanga City for proper disposition."

This is in contrary to the recommended practices prescribed by IMO MSC.1/circ. 1333 and 1334. Further, the master reported the incident to his flag State after two days, on 20 Feb 2017. Then also, he did not find it appropriate to report the incident to the port / local authorities. The ship was boarded and investigated by an ICG ship on 20 Feb 2017. The master reported the incident of theft to his local agent only after that. The agent thereafter filed a complaint with the Yellowgate police station, Mumbai, in late evening 20 Feb 2017. Extreme reluctance by the master to report the incident to local authorities was evident. The tendency to not to report incidents to port/local authorities is alarming. ReCAAP ISC may liaise with flag State FP to bring this to the notice of flag State administration.\n\nFurther the quantity of items reportedly stolen appears very heavy for two persons to carry manually into any small boat. \n\nDetailed report of investigation from the ICG is awaited.",

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, two white and yellow speed boats with two and three perpetrators in each of them respectively, approached the container ship from Sibago Island, Basilan Province. One of the armed perpetrators in one of the boats made a hand signal to stop and abruptly increased its speed to 14 knots, while the other speed boat proceeded towards the stern of the ship with one armed perpetrator attempting to climb onto the freeboard of the container ship. The master conducted a zig-zag manoeuvring which resulted in swaying of the rudder and propeller that eventually created intermittent waves which prompted the perpetrators to abort their intention to board the ship.\n\nThe perpetrators, armed with guns and assorted long rifles, then fired at the ship, which resulted in multiple bullet shots at the bridge area and the different parts of the ship."

The duty crew monitored the fishing boat, which eventually stopped near the forward part of the ship. Unknown to the crew, another boat also came alongside the bulk carrier. The duty A/B was on his routine round on the starboard side when he saw two perpetrators at the paint store. The perpetrators threatened him with a knife but the duty A/B managed to escape; and informed the bridge and other duty crew. The perpetrators jumped overboard and\nescaped when they saw the duty A/B calling on the radio. Investigation revealed that the padlock of the paint store was broken and found 16 cans of paint missing. It was assessed that the perpetrators had boarded the bulk carrier while the other boat served as a decoy."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While en route from Tanjung Bin, Malaysia to Bangkok, Thailand, the ship owner received several SSAS alerts from the tanker, which was carrying 2,100 metric tons of gasoline. The ship owner tried to contact the vessel but was unsuccessful. The ship owner/agent reported to the ReCAAP Focal Point (Singapore) and IFC, who informed the regional\nauthorities immediately. The Indonesian Navy reportedly deployed three vessels to locate the tanker.\n\nThe vessel was later located at approximately 3.5 nm north of Pulau Bintan, Indonesia (1° 15.03? N, 104° 25.35? E), reportedly experiencing engine problem and the crew was safe onboard. It was also reported that the tanker will be sailing back to Bangkok. However, the vessel continued to send out SSAS alerts thereafter. The vessel was also tracked by the owner to be moving in a southerly direction, off east of Pulau Bintan.\n\nThe ship owner later informed that nine pirates, who had boarded the tanker earlier, had left the vessel on 17 Oct 14 at or about 0700 hrs. The pirates had siphoned the gasoline onboard Suratchanya to another vessel (suspected to be\na chemical tanker), damaged all communications before they escaped. The 14 crew onboard was safe. Suratchanya subsequently sailed back to Thailand and reached Sriracha Harbour on 20 Oct 14 at or about 0930 hrs. The Thai authorities are currently investigating the incident."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, six pirates armed with guns boarded the oil product tanker. The vessel of 1074 GT was en route from Singapore to Bangkok, carrying 1,296 tonnes of lube oil. The pirates came alongside in a wooden speed boat, approached the vessel on the port quarter, and boarded from stern. They broke the bridge glass, gained access to the crew?s cabins and gathered the crew in the engine room. The pirates temporarily took control of the vessel and sailed about 10 nm away from the location of boarding. They ordered the crew to open all cargo valves, activate the cargo pump and transfer the lube oil to two tankers which came alongside. The pirates also stole the crew?s personal belongings, damaged the navigational and communication system before they left V.L. 14 at about 0400 hrs on 29 Aug 14. The crew managed to repair the windlass, heaved up the anchor, sailed towards Pulau Tioman and reported the incident to the company. The vessel returned to Thailand on 1 Sep 14. The crew was not injured.\n\nUpon receiving report about the incident from the ship owner on 29 Aug 14, the ReCAAP ISC alerted the MMEA and triggered the ReCAAP Focal Point (Thailand) to follow up with the investigation of the incident."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "On 25 Oct 16 at about 2030 hrs, more than 10 perpetrators boarded the Malaysian-registered tug boat, Ever Ocean Silk towing barge, Ever Giant at approximately 60 nm north of Bintulu, Sarawak, East Malaysia.  The tug boat and barge, which was laden with palm oil, had departed Lahad Datu, Sabah, East Malaysia on 20 Oct 16 and were expected to arrive at Port Klang, Selangor, Malaysia on 1 Nov 16.  The perpetrators armed with parangs (long knives) had come alongside the tug boat in a speed boat and a wooden boat, similar to a fishing boat.\n\nOnce on board, the perpetrators gathered and tied the 10 Indonesian crew in a cabin.  It was reported that the perpetrators instructed one of the crew to teach them how to navigate to their desired location.  The crew tried to navigate the ships closer to coast but was assaulted by the perpetrators who discovered his intention.  The crew then adjusted to the perpetrators? desired course and later locked up with the other crew.\n\nIn the morning of 26 Oct 16, the master managed to free himself and the perpetrators were nowhere to be found.  The master had to stop the tug boat as the perpetrators had stolen the communication and navigation equipment on board and he was unable to ascertain his current location.  In addition, the perpetrators also stole personal belongings of the crew and 2,499 metric tons of palm oil (estimated S$5 million) from the barge.\n\nThe owner of the tug boat reported the incident to the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA), Bintulu after they had lost communications with the tug boat.  Three MMEA assets (KM Tabah, KM Jepak and Penggalang 33) were dispatched and on 26 Oct 16 at about 1525 hrs, KM Jepak located the ships at about 30 nm off Tanjung Kidurong, Sarawak.  The crew was safe on board.  The tug boat and barge were subsequently escorted by the MMEA assets to Bintulu port."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, the Master and the Chief Officer were on their rounds to ensure proper anti-piracy watch was maintained when they were attacked by two perpetrators armed with knives and a pistol. The Master, Chief Officer and the duty crew were taken to the bridge and had their hands tied. It was later found out that the rest of the crew were taken to the Mess Room by another three perpetrators who were armed with knives.\n\nThe Master switched off the BNWAS alarm and slowed his ship under duress. The armed perpetrators took the Master to his cabin and forced him to hand over all the petty cash. The Master and all the crew were later taken to the Mess Room and held there.\n\nAfter 10 min, the Master and Chief Officer managed to escape from the Mess Room. A search was conducted within the accommodation block and bridge but the perpetrators had already left the ship. It was later discovered that the armed perpetrators had went through the ship?s cargo manifest and stowage plan.\n\nAt 2220 hrs (LT), the Master released all his crew, navigated the ship to safety and contacted the company. He then activated the SSAS and broadcasted a warning message through VHF Channel 16 to vessels in the vicinity. IFC was also informed."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "On 8 May 16, the ReCAAP ISC received information on the mobile app from a shipping company about the loss of communications with one of their ships, a Cook Islands-registered oil product tanker, Hai Soon 12. The shipping company had lost communications with Hai Soon 12 for about 12 hours and the ship did not respond to the company?s attempts to contact the ship.\n\nHai Soon 12, carrying 4,000 metric tons of MGO, had departed Singapore and was supposed to travel down via Sunda Straits to the Southern Ocean to conduct high seas bunkering / selling MGO to fishing vessels. However, the ship deviated from her planned route and travelled in an easterly direction towards Sulawesi instead.\n\nUpon receipt of the information, the ReCAAP ISC immediately informed BAKAMLA, who in turn shared the information with the TNI-AL. The incident was also reported to the IFC, who worked closely with the shipping company to monitor the position of Hai Soon 12. Two TNI-AL ships were despatched to locate Hai Soon 12, who maintained her course towards Bawean Island until on 8 May 16 at about 2211 hrs, she altered course tracking eastwards.\n\nOn 9 May 16 at about 1430 hrs, the TNI-AL ships intercepted and boarded Hai Soon 12. Nine perpetrators were found on board the ship and were arrested. All 21 crew members of Hai Soon 12 were safe and not injured. The cargo was also found to be intact. The ship was reportedly renamed to ?AISO?.\n\nInitial investigations revealed that on 7 May 16 at about 2045 hrs, nine perpetrators climbed up the poop deck of Hai Soon 12 from a small boat in waters off Pulau Belitung. The crew was tied up in the mess room. Arrangements were overheard stating the intent to sell the MGO in the night. Hai Soon 12 has since been detained and is in Surabaya for further investigation."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "Brahma 12, towing a barge, was en route to Batangas, Philippines from Kalimantan, Indonesia to deliver processed coal. On 26 Mar 16 at about 1000 hrs, Brahma 12 was found abandoned by a passing ship, who then towed the tug boat to Marang Wharf, Languyan Municipality, Tawi-Tawi Province, Philippines.  Brahma 12 was turned over to the Languyan Municipal Police for temporary safekeeping and custody.  \n\nInitial investigations revealed that 17 perpetrators armed with firearms boarded and hijacked the tug boat. The 10 Indonesian crew of Brahma 12 was taken hostage and the barge was cast off. The perpetrators ransacked all the detachable items on board the tug boat such as SOLAS and navigational equipment. The perpetrators then abandoned the tug boat and kidnapped the Indonesian crew. The ship owner has reportedly informed that the perpetrators are demanding a ransom for the release of the crew. It was also reported that on 1 Apr 16, the barge that was cast off had been recovered by the MMEA. Investigation is ongoing."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While the tug boat towing Singapore-registered barge MICLYN 258 was underway, perpetrators were sighted at the astern of barge. The vessels were en route to Pasir Gudang, Malaysia from Delta Shipyard, Batam, Indonesia. The crew of the tug boat shone their search light towards the barge as the vessel continued sailing towards Pasir Gudang. The master reported the incident to Indonesian Navy.\n\nOn 18 Sep 15 at about 0100 hrs (local time), the tug boat parked alongside barge MICLYN 258 and dropped anchor. The crew conducted their security checks and found several items missing. It was suspected that all the robbers had left after the ship shone search lights towards the barge. At about 0140 hrs (local time), MMEA officers boarded CREST GOLD 1 for investigation.\n\nThe Master was unable to determine if the suspected robbers were armed as well as how and when they boarded the barge. There was no reported injury to crew and no reported damage to the ship."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While en route from Tanjung Pinang, Indonesia to Langkawi, Malaysia, an unknown number of perpetrators boarded the bunker tanker. The ship was carrying 3,500 metric tons of fuel oil. Her last known position on 8 Aug 15 at about 1350 hrs was at approximately 29 nm north of Pulau Rupat, Malacca Strait. The AIS onboard the vessel was reportedly turned off. The shipping company reported the incident to the IFC who notified the ReCAAP ISC, MMEA HQ, the Indonesian authorities and the shipping community to locate the vessel. The Malaysian and Indonesian authorities had reportedly deployed surface and air assets to search for her. The ReCAAP ISC had also informed its contacts in the MMEA and the Indonesian Marine Police.\n\nOn the morning of 9 Aug 15, the MMEA located Joaquim at approximately 14.1 nm off Tanjung Kling (02° 03? N, 101° 59.39? E). Initial reporting revealed that about 3,000 metric tons of fuel oil had reportedly been siphoned and power to the generator was cut off. The crew was safe except for the master and bunker crew who were injured after being punched by the perpetrators. The two crew were later heli-evacuated by the MMEA for medical treatment."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "The company had been receiving hourly position update of Orkim Harmony until the last reporting on 11 Jun 15 at about 2054 hrs. Subsequently, attempts to contact the vessel on all available communications were not successful. The ship?s last known position was at approximately 17 nm southwest of Pulau Aur, Malaysia. Orkim Harmony was carrying 6,000 metric tonnes of ULG 95 (petrol) and had crew comprising Indonesians, Malaysians and Myanmar nationals onboard. The MMEA and the Indonesian Navy had reportedly deployed patrol boats to search for Orkim Harmony.\n\nOn 17 Jun 15, the VCG, which is also the ReCAAP Focal Point (Vietnam), informed the ReCAAP ISC that they had been notified by MMEA that an Australian patrol aircraft had localized a vessel at approximately 84 nm southwest of Phu Quoc in the Gulf of Thailand (09° 21? N 102° 44? E) on 17 Jun 15 at about 1446 hrs. The vessel renamed ?Kim Harmon? matches the description of Orkim Harmony.\n\nUpon receipt of the information, the VCG despatched two patrol ships to the area to search for Orkim Harmony. The RTN, which is also the ReCAAP Focal Point (Thailand), and the RMN had also standby their assets to be deployed. The VCG reported that an MMEA aircraft had flown over the area and the vessel was reported to be located at 09° 10? N 103°10? E. Two Malaysian ships, KD Terengganu (RMN) and KM Amanah (MMEA) were deployed to the area to take over Orkim Harmony. Reportedly, the perpetrators managed to escape and the authorities were tracking their whereabouts. At about 0050 hrs on 19 Jun 15, the crew of Orkim Harmony was reported to be safe except for one crew who was injured.\n\nIn the afternoon of 19 Jun 15, the VCG informed the ReCAAP ISC that they had arrested eight Indonesians, who are suspected to be involved in the hijacking of Orkim Harmony. The VCG also seized the boat that the suspects were in, which is reportedly the life boat of Orkim Harmony. The suspects claimed that their fishing vessel had sunk. It was later confirmed that the eight Indonesians are involved in the incident. Initial findings revealed that five more suspects were still at large as they had left Orkim Harmony to look for buyer of the ULG onboard the tanker. Investigation is ongoing."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While en route to Kuantan port, Malaysia from Sg Udang, Malacca, Malaysia, more than eight perpetrators boarded the oil product tanker. Following the investigation carried out by the MMEA, the ReCAAP ISC was informed that the perpetrators were armed with two hand guns and one machete; wore masks, t-shirts and were barefooted. They threatened the crew (comprising eight Malaysians, seven Indonesians and three Myanmar nationals) and reportedly assaulted them, though no injuries were reported.\n\nThe perpetrators subsequently brought Orkim Victory to another location at approximately 15.2 nm southwest of Pulau Aur, Malaysia where a motor tanker with a white superstructure and a black hull (approximately 100 m in length and 2,000 GT) came alongside; and siphoned off 770 metric tons of Marine Diesel Oil. The siphoning took about seven hours and the suspected tanker was seen heading towards Pulau Matak, Anambas, Indonesia thereafter. The perpetrators left Orkim Victory at approximately 10.4 nm south-southwest of Pulau Aur, Malaysia after damaging all communication equipment, and robbing the crew?s personal belongings. The master sent an INMARSAT C distress alert after the perpetrators left the vessel. The MMEA responded by deploying one helicopter, three ships and five boats to locate the suspected tanker, but did not manage to find the suspect tanker."

Post investigation by Kandla Port, PFSO and CGS Vadinar following has been brought out:\n\n(a) The vessel claims three deck watchmen were on duty for patrolling but still nobody saw any intruder boarding the vessel.\n\n(b) The method of boarding the vessel is not clear which is assumed to be fire wire.\n\n(c) The robbery is an assumption on Boson store padlock being broken and some fire hoses and nozzles being missing.\n\n(d) There is no mention how the steel anchor hosepipe cover could be forcibly opened from underneath. There is no possibility of climbing through the anchor hawse pipe using fire wire because both are located at two different places.\n\n(e) There is no indication of the number of intruders of whether they were armed as nobody saw anyone.\n\n(f) Foot print on the forecastle deck do not confirm an intruder as they could belong to the ship?s crew.\n\n(g) The vessel did not inform the Port authorities, the PFSO or the Police. The vessel sailed out of the port on 18 May 15 at 1715 hours and no indication of the above incident was given to the outgoing Pilot.\n\n(h) There is no information from the company or the agent regarding the above incident to the Port authorities.\n\n(i) The report has been received by the Port only on 20 May 15 and since the vessel has sailed out of the port two days ago, there is no possibility of any investigation in the absence of the vessel or any witness.",

A message was also sent to the vessel but there was no reply.\n\nRoyal Malaysian Navy (RMN) vessel, KD Terengganu arrived at the location of the incident at 1300 hrs and boarded Oriental Glory for investigation. TNI-AL also reportedly deployed KRI SUTANTO (377) in response.\n\nInitial investigations revealed that pirates had boarded Oriental Glory on 15 Jul 14 at or about 2345 hrs and destroyed the vessel's comunication systems and main engine. The anchor windlass and machineries were also found damaged. 1,600 metric tonnes (out of 2,500 metric tonnes) of marine fuel oil was siphoned off. The robbers also stole MYR15,000 worth of cash, and personal items including watch, laptop and perfumes. The robbers left the vessel at 0350hrs."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "On 4 Jul 14, the shipping company reported to the IFC that product tanker, Moresby 9, carrying 2200 metric tonne of MGO was boarded by unknown number of pirates. The IFC alerted the regional navies and enforcement agencies. The ReCAAP ISC immediately worked with the IFC and alerted the regional maritime authorities in the area, including the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) who responded that their assets were on standby nevertheless, noting that the location of boarding was not within their territorial waters. The Indonesian Navy reportedly deployed their ships to the location of the incident. However, they were not able to locate Morseby 9 off Anambas. The last known position of Moresby 9 was at approximately 36 nm from Anambas islands (03° 22.21? N, 105° 08.09? E).\n\nOn 5 Jul 14, the shipping company managed to establish communications with Moresby 9 and instructed her to anchor at approximately 3.9 nm southeast of Tanjung Ramunia, Johor (01° 20? N, 104° 19.3? E). MMEA vessel, KM TEGAS boarded the tanker to conduct an inspection and interview of the crew. MMEA informed that on 4 Jul 14 at 0430 hrs, Moresby 9 departed for Hong Kong after loading 2135 metric tons of Marine Gas Oil (MGO). On the same day, at or about 2015 hrs while the tanker was underway at approximately 48.6 nm northwest of Pulau Anambas (03° 45.93? N, 105° 10.24? E), an unmarked vessel came alongside Moresby 9. The crew heard a gunshot and suddenly nine pirates armed with machetes and three pistols were sighted on the deck of Moresby 9. Two more shots were fired. The pirates gathered the crew at the STBD bridge wing, tied and locked them in the engine control room except the Chief Officer who was detained at the bridge for navigation purposes. At about 2140 hrs, the tanker was forced to anchor at approximately 39.4 nm northwest of Pulau Anambas (03° 35.81? N, 105° 12.53? E) and her engines were turned off. At this point, the Chief Officer who was at the bridge allegedly noticed an approx 3000 GT orange motor tanker came alongside Moresby 9 and siphoned off 2118 metric tons to the orange motor tanker between 2200 hrs on 4 Jul 14 till 0400 hrs on 5 Jul 14. This was discovered by the crew later, when some of the crew managed to get out from the engine control room through funnel."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "On 14 Jun 14, the shipping company reported to the ReCAAP ISC that an unknown number of pirates had boarded the product tanker from three speed boats. Ai Maru had departed western Singapore OPL for the Gulf of Thailand with 1520 metric tonne of MGO onboard. On receipt of the information, the ReCAAP ISC immediately worked with the IFC and alerted the regional maritime authorities in the area. Whilst the vessel continued to head south-easterly at a speed of about 4.5 knots, the maritime authorities from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia responded to the incident and deployed their assets to the location. \n\nA total of six vessels from the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA), Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL) and Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) were deployed. At or about 0050 hrs, Ai Maru was observed to be drifting with its shipboard lighting turned on, as the maritime authorities closed in. Investigation later revealed that seven pirates armed with pistols and knives boarded the product tanker, tied the crew and locked them in a room. They damaged the ship?s communication equipment and stole the crew?s personal belongings including laptops, cash and mobile phones; and fled after seeing the enforcement agencies? vessels pursuing. The pirates only managed to escape with 620 metric ton of MGO (which was 40% of the total cargo onboard), an amount they would not make off with, if not because of the presence of the authorities."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "Tug boat, Manyplus 12 towing barge, Hub 18, loaded with 138 containers had departed Sibu, Sarawak, East Malaysia for Port Klang, Peninsular Malaysia. The vessels were scheduled to arrive at Port Klang in the morning of 13 Jun 14. However, the vessels did not arrive at Port Klang on the scheduled date. The shipping company?s last contacted the master on 9 Jun 14 at or about 1910 hrs when the vessels were approximately 61.37 nm west of Tanjung Datu, Sarawak. There were 11 crew onboard the tug boat.\n\nThe ReCAAP ISC immediately informed the regional authorities and Focal Points regarding the missing tug boat and barge. The ReCAAP ISC also issued an Incident Alert urging the ReCAAP Focal Points, the maritime authorities and vessels in the vicinity to look out for Manyplus 12 and Hub 18; and report sightings of the vessels and crew to the nearest coastal State, noting that the colour and name of the vessels may have been repainted.\n\nOn 22 Jun 14, the ReCAAP ISC received information that Hub 18 with 11 crew onboard has been located. The crew was rescued by Vietnamese fishing boat at about 100 nm northwest of Kota Kinabalu on 22 Jun 14 at 1612 hrs, and that the barge was left adrift.\n\nThe Philippine Navy deployed its asset on 24 Jun 14 about\n0715 hrs and conducted aerial reconnaissance. Hub 18 was sighted abandoned and drifting at about 15 nm southwest off Abad Santos Shoal. However, Manyplus 12 was not within the area. On 25 Jun 14, Hub 18 was towed by LCC 550 to Ulugan Bay, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan and arrived in the area at 26 Jun 14 at about 0730 hrs. On 30 Jun 14, a joint inspection onboard Hub 18 was conducted by the representatives from Department of Foreign Affairs, Philippine Navy, Bureau of Immigration and Bureau of Customs. The containers onboard the barge contained frozen products, vegetables and various new and used vehicle spare parts. Some of the containers had been opened and empty. Other damages to the barge were broken windows and dents in the hull. The perpetrators had left behind some tools they used to open the containers and spare parts from the containers were scattered around. To date, Manyplus 12 is still missing."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, 10 pirates armed with guns and knives boarded the tanker from a small speed boat. The pirates tied the crew and proceeded to the bridge to control the tanker. The pirates also repainted the ship name from ORAPIN 4 to RAPI, and destroyed the communication equipment onboard, and cut off all communications. Another tanker came alongside Orapin 4 and approximately 3,700 metric tonnes of ADF was siphoned from Orapin 4. The pirates took about 10 hours in siphoning before leaving the tanker and crew with enough fuel to sail back to shore. The master and crew regained control of the vessel and arrived at Sriracha Port, Chon Buri, Thailand on 1 Jun 14."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, eight armed pirates boarded the vessel via the port side aft from a speed boat. The pirates instructed the crew to assemble on the bridge and the vessel was made to anchor at approximately 19.21 nm southeast of Pulau Aur, Malaysia. The pirates searched the tanker?s cargo and realised that the vessel carried hot asphalt and not diesel. The pirates used the VHF (Channel 77) to communicate with their other team members who appeared to assist them in the search. They took the master and the crew to the engine control room and instructed them to remain in the room until 1200 hrs. When the master and the crew came out from the engine control room, the pirates had already escaped. Cash and personal belongings of the crew were stolen; and the vessel?s communication equipments were damaged."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "On 21 Apr 14 at or about 0620 hrs, Naniwa Maru No. 1 departed Singapore for the port of Yangon, Myanmar with 4,344 metric tonnes of Marine Diesel Oil onboard. On 22 Apr 14, the shipping company based in Singapore reported to the ReCAAP ISC that two vessels came alongside Naniwa Maru No. 1. Upon receipt of the information, the ReCAAP ISC immediately alerted the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA).\n\nSubsequently, the shipping company updated the ReCAAP ISC that five robbers appeared at the bridge, held the crew while they siphoned about 2,500 metric tonnes of Marine Diesel Oil and escaped. The company also reported that the master, chief officer and chief engineer (all Indonesians) were taken by the robbers, together with their personal belongings and travel documents. The rest of the crew was left onboard Naniwa Maru No. 1 without any injury. The shipping company reported that of the two vessels which came alongside Naniwa Maru No. 1, one of them was of a Mongolian flag, with a black and white hull, and shelter at the poop deck.\n\nThe MMEA boarded Naniwa Maru No. 1 and is working closely with the Indonesian Marine Police and authorities to establish where the two vessels were heading towards; and to locate the three missing crew."

  "attackMethodDesc" : "While underway, five robbers boarded the product tanker. The Second Officer and the A/B were on the bridge, fixated on small fishing boats ahead, when the robbers boarded. The A/B was instructed to lead four of the robbers to the Captain's cabin, while the leader of the robbers guarded over the Second Officer. \n\nWhen the AB returned together with the Captain, the crew was tied and led to a spare cabin. The Captain was ordered to steer the vessel and was threatened by the leader to follow instructions. After sailing for approximately 24 nm, the Captain was told to reverse the ship and head back to the original location. During this time, the robbers told the bosun to show them how to operate the winches and pumps.\n\nAn orange-hulled ship came alongside the product tanker, and it was observed that there was a slight collission and scratching sounds. From 0930hrs to 1530hrs, the robbers started to unload the 5000ppm MGO onboard GPT 21 when they were at approximately 2.5 nm south of the boarding location. The robbers knew exactly the types of MGO on board, and in which tanks. \n\nAt approximately 1600hrs, the crew heard no more noises and therefore managed to escape. When the Captain and the crew got to the bridge, they saw 2 ships in the distance with the MMSI numbers 567030700 and 56541300. The crew found orange paint marks on the side of the ship. They also found out that personal belongings including laptops, handphones and cash were stolen, and the ship's equipment including a portable gas detector, VHF marine communications, knives, screwdrivers and spanners were taken as well."

One of the crew managed to alert other vessels anchored nearby via the vessel's radio. The robbers gathered the crew, including the master, in the mess room. The robbers then ordered the master to sail the vessel to Tompok Utara. After a few minutes of sailing, eight of the robbers left the product tanker. The two remaining robbers then commanded the master to sail to Pulau Lima instead. Thereafter, the two robbers noticed a MMEA patrol vessel approaching and escaped through the port side of the bridge."
