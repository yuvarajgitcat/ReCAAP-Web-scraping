The master of the DA reported that the crew had spotted an individual armed with what appeared to be a gun on deck. The master indicated that the crew had locked themselves in their cabins and requested immediate assistance. Given that the vessel was in transit and its current position, the POCC advised the master to contact Batam Authority on VHF Channel 16 for help.\n\nAt around 0458 hours, VTIS Central followed up with DA to check if they had sought assistance from Batam Authority. The master confirmed that they did not require any assistance and planned to conduct a search in daylight, thus were unable to confirm if any assets were stolen. The master also stated that all crew members were accounted for, there were no injuries, and no further assistance was needed.\n\nDA is a transit vessel to Caofeidian, China.",

The ship altered its course to starboard to keep a safe distance from the boat. However, at a distance of about 1.5 miles, the boat suddenly started flashing lights and accelerated, making a desperate attempt to board the ship. The ship performed evasive manoeuvres to deter the boarding attempt, and immediately notified Singapore VTIS East. Upon sighting a RSN ship in the vicinity, the small boat aborted its attempt and moved away from the ship. The ship had implemented additional lookout measures to monitor for suspicious boats as part of its security measures, in accordance with BMP5 best practices."

The bridge was informed immediately via VHF and the forward watchman shouted at the men. The OOW raised the alarm and sounded the forward whistle.

During inspection, all stores? padlocks were intact and no item was stolen. The master also informed Philippine General Santos (PHGES) agent to support the security perimeter. The guards kept watch within the wharf but were not allowed onboard the ship.\n\nOn the same day at about 0305 hrs, one unidentified person was sighted by the duty AB at the gangway area (port side) of the ship. The duty AB immediately informed the OOW and proceeded to the area. Upon seeing the duty AB, the perpetrator immediately jumped into the water. Thereafter, the master and crew carried out a search in the engine room, accommodation and main deck. They found that padlocks of the fire station locker and chemical locker were broken. However, no item was missing or stolen. Furthermore, the hospital watertight door was opened but locked from the inside door. The crew was not injured during the two occurrences.\n\nOn the same day at about 1330 hrs, the Philippine Coast Guard-Port State Control (PCG-PSC) boarded the ship and conducted verification of the incident. The master and crew were advised to be vigilant and strengthen their security measures while at Port of General Santos City. PCG-PSC also directed the PCG units within the area to conduct maritime patrol to prevent occurrence of such incidents."

As the master and second officer of the ship could not contact the duty watcher, the deck cadet went to check.  While checking, the deck cadet noticed a perpetrator with a knife who shouted at him not to move. The deck cadet escaped and reported the incident to the bridge using a two-way radio.\n\nAt about 0142 hrs, the master sounded the alarm and whistle, used the search light as counter-measures and conducted muster of crew. The second officer found the duty watcher and untied him. At about 0150 hrs, the five perpetrators left the ship using a loose rope and escaped in their small boat.
